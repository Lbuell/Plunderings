## Description
**Rails App** If you are a pirate and you need to keep track of all your plunderings and how much loot you have gotten, and how many wenches/jewels/gold you have amassed this is the way to go!  You are a Pirate and you, in your voyages, will obtain much loot through plunderings and pillages.  This is a simple way of creating a has_many through relationship in rails. It's so simple and elegant!  This way you are able to connect two models through another model.  In this case;  Pirates are connected to loot through plunderings.
